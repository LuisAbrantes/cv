    <h1>The Revenge of the Sith</h1>
    <p>
        3 years after "Attack of the Clones", the film begins in a space battle, in which Obi-Wan, Anakin, his former Padawan,
        current Jedi Knight and his droid R2-D2, who were going to a Separatist Dreadnaught to save the Senator Palpatine from 
        the hands of the sith Count Dookan and the head of the armed forces, General Grievous, they manage to make a very risky
        landing and they found many droids, they managed to kill them all, they found Chancellor Palpatine in a chair, however
        imprisoned, but soon in Next Count Dooku arrived, in a fight, knocked Obi-Wan out, Anakin got angry, and cut off Dooku's
        hands, and after a bad influence from the Chancellor, Anakin killed Dooku, who was unarmed, so like a Jedi, Anakin didn't
        could kill him. Obi-Wan was on Anakin's back, and in a fall he woke up, on solid ground, R2-D2 was reunited with the
        others and everyone was trapped by an energy shield and taken to Grievous. In one battle, they won, but the General
        ended up fleeing, and in an emergency landing, escorted by firefighters, as most of the ship had already been blown up, 
        and they succeeded, Anakin was consecrated the hero and Obi-Wan went to do the Reporting to the Jedi Council and Grievous 
        was considered top priority capture in the Republic so they could end the war as quickly as possible, Padmé told Anakin 
        that she was pregnant, which was a big surprise to both of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Grievous fled to the planet of Utapau, and there he conversed with the Sith Lord, who said that Count Dooku's death was a 
        necessary death and ordered Grievous to send Separatist leaders to the system of Mustafar, a volcanic country. When Anakin 
        was sleeping he had a nightmare about Padmé's death during childbirth, which many people, including me, believe that it 
        was Lord Sidious who made this dream happen (you'll understand later on). To boost his ego, Palpatine called Anakin, 
        nominating him to be a Jedi Master, but the Council didn't accept anything by appointment and refused the request, leaving 
        Skywalker in the council but not consecrating him as a Master, which affected Anakin's relationship with the Council, 
        mainly because right away Obi-Wan said that he wants Anakin to report all of the Chancellor's actions to the Council, 
        because he wants them to know what he's planning. Yoda went to the Wookiee planet, Kashyyyk. Anakin went to the 
        Chancellor Ceremony, which revealed Grievous's location and began recounting the arts of the dark side of force and 
        bad-mouthing the Council, like the legend of the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise, "Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord Sith, 
        so powerful and so wise, that he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had so much 
        knowledge of the dark side that he could keep those close to him from dying", obviously Anakin was very interested, 
        and it is that's why I think that who made Anakin's dream with Padmé dying was Palpatine, because from then on he started 
        to be interested in the dark side.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yoda was on mission in Kashyyyk and there, a great battle was drawn up. Anakin insisted that Obi-Wan could take him 
        along on the mission, but it didn't happen, Obi-Wan went to Utapau, after Grievous and Anakin went to Padmé's house and 
        there, again he had the same thought of Padmé's death and maybe of babies, Anakin becomes more and more greedy and 
        clinging to things.
    </p>

    <p>
        Obi-Wan met General Grievous, who had four robotic arms that can rotate 360° countless times and fought an 
        incredible battle, and killed him with a shot to the heart. I'll make the video available at the end. Obi-Wan passed the 
        report on to the Council and Master Mace Windu ordered Anakin to pass the report on to the Chancellor so that his reaction 
        would give some clue to his intentions. And that's when Palpatine began to objectively say that the Jedi want his harm and 
        that with him (Palpatine), he began to say that with him, Anakin will know the subtleties of the Force, claiming that his 
        mentor taught him all about the force. , even the nature of the dark side, because if one wants to understand the great 
        mystery one must study and understand all aspects, not just in the "dogmatic and narrow" view of the Jedi, because 
        according to him if Anakin wants to become a complete leader and wise, he must "embrace" a broader vision of the Force 
        and only through him will he be able to attain a power greater than any Jedi, and insisting that he learn the dark 
        side of the Force and only then will he save his wife from certain death . And it was from there that I began to 
        believe with more certainty that Anakin's dreams were manipulated by Palpatine, even from afar, as he is considered 
        the tenth most powerful Sith Lord in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anakin went to hand him over to the Jedi Council, so Mace Windu gathered a group of 4 Jedi, he (Mace Windu), Kit-Fisto,
        Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin, and went to the Chancellor's office to kill him, Agen Kolar and Saesee Tiin died in 
        Palpatine's first attack, but Kit Fisto dies shortly thereafter, so the fight was fought only by Mace Windu and Palpatine, 
        Mace Windu was going to arrest him, at which time Anakin arrives, so Palpatine attacks with the Sith Lightning, but the 
        Master manages to defend with his saber, but at one point Palpatine was too weak, as these rays reflected on him, Mace 
        Windu would kill him, when Anakin confronted him orally saying he would have to be judged, Mace Windu defends his idea, 
        saying that he has control of the Senate, and that he is too dangerous to stay alive, but even so, the Master went to 
        attack Palpatine with his saber, but Anakin cut his arm, Palpatine consumed him with his Sith beam and threw him to outside 
        the building.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that Anakin was sorry, but after a brief conversation with now, Lord Sidious, he gave himself up to the dark side, 
        but in return, Sidious would have to help him save Padmé, and so Anakin was renamed Darth Vader. Then Master Yoda felt in 
        the force what happened. Sidious said that all Jedi were enemies of the Republic, and ordered him to go to the Jedi temple 
        to take them by surprise, without hesitation and without mercy and then ordered him to go to Mustafar's system to take the 
        lives of the Separatist leaders, and also said that the treachery of the Jedi across the galaxy will be punished, and only 
        then, Anakin will be strong enough on the dark side to save Padmé and once again the Sith have ruled the galaxy and they 
        will have peace again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile Obi-Wan and his 212 legion, commanded by the 212 were still on Utapau fighting the Separatist droids and as he 
        was leveling up one of the holes, Sidious communicated to him by a hologram saying, "Commander Cody, the time has come, 
        execute Order 66" and Cody ordered his battalion to hunt Obi-Wan, they managed to hit him, but it didn't kill him or 
        hurt him, he fell to the bottom of the hole, into one side, they tried to find the body, obviously they couldn't, 
        Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was also attacked by his troops, and died. Master Aayla Secura, master Plo-koon among many others and 
        when they went to attack Grand Master Yoda, he was already prepared, as he had felt what had happened, so he cut off the 
        heads of the two clones who did it, and then , Chewbacca and Tarfful took Yoda to an escape pod, where he would communicate 
        and meet Bail Organa in the future. Meanwhile, Anakin and his legion, the 501, were killing everyone who was there, 
        including Padawans and Younglings. Bail Organa went to the Council to see what was happening, because everything was 
        on fire, when he got there, the clones told him to leave and a Padawan came attacking the same clones, asking him to flee 
        and then he ended up dying.
    </p>

    <p>
        Organa and Yoda got together and sent the location to Kenobi. Anakin went to Padmé to say he would end the war by killing 
        Separatist leaders for Mustafar. During a meeting between Kenobi, Yoda and Senator Organa, the Jedi decided to return to 
        the temple to cancel a message telling all Jedi to return to the temple as a war was over, thus managing to kill the 
        surviving Jedi and Organa would go to a meeting held by the current Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin arrived in 
        Mustafar and there, he let himself be taken 100% by the dark side, because even his eyes had turned yellow due to his 
        anger, a feeling that was a result of the dark side, and I fulfilled his mission. On Coruscant, the meeting had 
        already started and Obi-Wan and Yoda had entered the Council building and killed many clones, and there they discovered 
        that not all Jedi had been shot dead, previous to the ones killed by lightsaber. , but the question that had remained for 
        the masters is: "Who did this". During the Senate meeting, the Supreme Chancellor announced a coup, in which the formerly 
        democratic Galactic Republic to the undemocratic Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan modified the messages and when he was retreating, 
        he decided to know who did the tragedy, so even without Yoda's recommendation, and he saw it was his former apprentice, 
        Yoda said they must destroy the Sith, Obi-Wan insists so that he can face the now Emperor, but Yoda denied it, he said that 
        Obi-Wan wasn't strong enough to face him, so Obi-Wan went to Padmé to get Anakin's location and explain what happened, and 
        found that Anakin is the baby's father, but she doesn't speak, so she goes to Mustafar to meet him, and Obi-Wan sneaks into 
        the ship and goes with him.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anakin delivered the report to the Emperor, who ordered him to send a message to the Trade Federation ships, telling them 
        to shut down all droid units (after all, the clones had become their new army), but the ship of Padmé arrived and obviously 
        he gave priority to it, he was running towards her, she said that Obi-Wan said horrible things to her, like that he killed 
        children and etc... Which made him very angry with her. former Master and started talking about his dictatorial ideas, 
        which made Padmé extremely sad, as she has been a Democratic politician for many years, and Obi-Wan appeared at a time 
        when Anakin was very angry with Obi-Wan for allegedly making Padmé himself turn against him (Anakin) and then he calls 
        her a liar because she was with Obi-Wan on the ship and Anakin thought she brought him on purpose to kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
        As agreed, Yoda went after the Emperor, at the bottom of the page there is a recording of the two fights, when the 
        Emperor's was over, he felt that Lord Vader was at risk, so he sent Captain Kagi to prepare the ship for Mustafar, and 
        Obi- Wan ends up winning Anakin and had left him for dead and ended up being burned by the lava river, he ended up 
        surviving (as everyone knows), because when Anakin was about to die, Palpatine arrived and managed to save his apprentice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Meanwhile, Obi-Wan took Padmé to the safe place where he, Yoda and Organa would meet so they could deliver and discuss 
        the future, in childbirth she lost the will to live because she was 100% physically, and they had to have emergency surgery 
        to save the babies, nobody knew it was twins, a boy and a girl. Padmé named the boy Luke and the girl Leia. Vader was also 
        undergoing emergency surgery, where he gained the appearance we know today.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 3 survivors got together to decide what each would do and what would happen to the babies, and it was decided that 
        Organa would take Leia to Alderaan, as he and his wife had always wanted to adopt a girl and there she would be very well 
        cared for. and educated, Yoda would go into exile in Dagobah, to become wiser in the Force and learn more about it, like 
        the power to unify and become one with it, and Obi-Wan would take the boy to Tatooine until his local family, and Obi-Wan 
        would stay there protecting the boy, Master Yoda said that until the time was right, they would remain missing.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the meeting, Yoda called Obi-Wan to talk, the theme was that while he was in exile on Tatooine, he would have a 
        training for him, saying that an old friend had learned the path of immortality, one that had returned from the spirit 
        world. of the Force, your former Master, Yoda will teach you the way to communicate with him. Obi-Wan is very happy and 
        obviously accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bail Organa delivered R2-D2 and C3-PO to Captain Antilles' care, had him clean them up, treat them well, and erase the 
        protocol droid's memory (C3-PO). On Naboo, Padmé's wake was held, many people attended, after all, she who represented 
        Naboo in the Galactic Senate and had previously been queen. And at the end of the film, it shows Darth Vader and the 
        Emperor watching the construction of the Death Star, Bail Organa introducing Leia to his wife, Breha Organa and 
        finally Obi-Wan delivering Luke Skywalker to his aunt Beru Lars and his uncle Owen Lars, that followed the sunset, 
        a scene that was very successful 19 years later (in the Star Wars chronology), with Luke older and in exactly the same 
        place, a scene portrayed in the movie "A New Hope".
